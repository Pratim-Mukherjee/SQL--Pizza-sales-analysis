# SQL--Pizza-sales-analysis

Introduction
Welcome to Analyzing Pizza Sales Trends with SQL.
In this presentation, we will explore the data-driven
approach to understanding pizza sales. We will
analyze trends and make informed decisions based
on real-time data. 

Understanding Data
Data Overview We have a database with four
tables, each containing 1,000 entries:
 1. order_details: Tracks order specifics
(order_id, pizza_id, quantity, price).

2. orders: Contains order summaries (order_id,
customer_id, order_date).

3. pizza_types: Describes pizza varieties
(pizza_type_id, name, category, ingredients).

4. pizzas: Lists individual pizzas (pizza_id,
pizza_type_id, size, price).

 These tables together provide insights into
orders, customer preferences, and pizza
details.
